Hi! Welcome to my Github.

I'm a lawyer who decided to change career, and have been studying tirelessly to become a back-end web developer. I also like to read about computer stuff in my freetime, like OS and computer networks, it really fascinates me.

I started to use Linux to practice and visualize what I learn about OS.

I'm currently learning to code in Python and Java and their frameworks, Django and Springboot.

Here you can find some things I've already made, I'll make those repositories grow (almost) every single day.
