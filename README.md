Hi! Welcome to my Github.

I'm a lawyer who decided to change career, and have been studying tirelessly to become a back-end web developer. I also like to read about random computer stuff in my freetime, like SO and computer networks, it really fascinates me.

I'm currently learning to code in Python (along with some libraries and frameworks like Django, Numpy, Pandas) and Java.

Here you can find some things I've already made, I'll make those repositories grow (almost) every single day.
