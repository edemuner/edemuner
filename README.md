Hi! Welcome to my Github.

I'm a lawyer who decided to change career, and have been studying tirelessly to become a back-end web developer. I also like to read about computer stuff in my freetime, like OS and computer networks, it really fascinates me.

I'm currently learning to code in Node.JS, and have been building a few apps and services to train back-end development core concepts.

I also know a bit about Python and Django, and I can do some things with Java as well.

Here you can find some things I've already made, I'll make those repositories grow (almost) every single day.
